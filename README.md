# A simple and minimalist desktop app to take screenshots. #

a miniature desktop app that displays a small button to take screenshots.
the app itself doesn't appear on the screenshot (hidden for 10 milliseconds).

Things you can customize :
- file names : currently 'SS_' followed by a timestamp in the following format "%d_%m_%Y_%H_%M_%S".
- the interface's size (currently set to not resizable).
- the text on the button (currently set to 'SS').

Update : added the option to pick and change directory
